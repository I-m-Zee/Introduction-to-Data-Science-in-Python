s = 'ACAABAACAAAB'
result = re.findall('A{1,2}', s)
L = len(result)
Ans:
5

Question 5
import re
s = 'ACBCAC'

Ans:
r[2:4,2:4]

Question 7
Which of the following is the correct output for the code given below?

import numpy as np
old = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])
new = old
new[0, :2] = 0
print(old)

Ans:
[[0 0 1][1 1 1]]

Question 8
Consider the following variables in Python:

a1 = np.random.rand(4)
a2 = np.random.rand(4, 1)
a3 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4]])
a4 = np.arange(1, 4, 1)
a5 = np.linspace(1 ,4, 4)

Which of the following statements regarding these variables is correct?

Ans:
a5.shape == a1.shape

Question 9
Assume a and b are two (20, 20) numpy arrays. The L2-distance (defined above) between two equal dimension arrays can be calculated in python as follows:

def l2_dist(a, b):
    result = ((a - b) * (a - b)).sum()
    result = result ** 0.5
    return result

Which of the following expressions using this function will give an error?

Ans:
l2_dist(np.reshape(a, (20 * 20)), np.reshape(b, (20 * 20, 1)))
